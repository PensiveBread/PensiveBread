# PensiveBread Commissions

Hey, I'm Pensive, but you can call me Samuel. I'm a Discord Bot Developer who primarily works in Python! From a young age, I've started to learn how to code and now I'm able to offer my services to Server Creators and Community Figures alike, giving the same quality of service to all. I can fluently code in Python - as if it's my second language!

I am familiarised with the discord python library and I'm able to integrate any bot with any service on the web with ease - even if it means having to make my own web server or API, I will go to any extent to ensure that you get the product that you paid for, even if I spend my own time or money on it.
